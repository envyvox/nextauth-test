For a long time there were no buildings on this territory, which today is surprising, because the **capital** is located on a perfect plain, next to a lovely garden, a little farther the ocean and huge fields. It wasn't until shortly before our time that the land came to our attention.

The **Sigenada** family with a cult warrior at their head noticed the beauty of the land.

It began with a small building, which was named "**Edo**". As time went on, the tiny building grew into a huge castle, with houses being built around it, infrastructure developing, and the city flourishing.

It seemed that nothing bad could happen, but alas a terrible thing happened. The city was attacked and captured. Now in the capital was a new ruler, who left his castle and territory, it is understandable, his fields were not fruitful, nearby there was no fresh water and access to the ocean. The leader of the invading clan was named **Toku**, who remains the ruler of **Edo** to this day. Toku built settlements around the capital, as well as a port. The ruler of **Edo** is of strict morals, he is rational, strict and does not give free will to his emotions in critical situations, but not all his actions and decisions are shared by representatives of neighboring cities.

As for the capital, no less interesting personalities have already taken root here. We are talking about **Toredo** - the owner of stores with the same name and the owner of the casino "**Cone**" by the name of **Joe**. They are two friends who came here from far away. Since childhood they have been competing with each other: who is the tougher, who is the luckier, etc. Now the dispute is about money. The two friends are arguing about whether trading or casinos will be more profitable.
