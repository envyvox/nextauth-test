"A marvelous place where the breeze spreads magic, you can't help but feel it."

Although the official version assures that this garden began to build **Toku** for his wife, there are rumors that the garden was in this place long before his reign.

The garden is divided into several parts, somewhere there is a bamboo forest, somewhere you can see an avenue of wild plum trees. Children constantly come here to taste berries, girls pick a bouquet of incredibly beautiful flowers, and boys make slingshots and sticks and branches.

The garden is so beautiful that you can devote a whole day and still not admire all its beauty. In addition to tasty and juicy berries, people are in a hurry to enrich themselves with spiritual food, for this they go deep into the garden, where there is a building shrouded in plants.

This is the library building, if you don't know where it is, you won't find it at all. Books from all parts of the world are collected here, and the library is run by **Nari**. She's been here since the beginning of the library, but no one has ever wondered why she looks the way she does, young, blonde, her skin doesn't age like she does.

The thing is, when you come to the garden, it's like you're in another world, you forget and forget everything. So who is **Nari**? She's the protector of the garden. At night, she transforms into a bird that emits light, flies up and flies around the area with her wings spread. She sees and knows what happens outside the garden: she has seen **Toku** conquer **Edo Castle**, the forests near it burning; she knows that Captain **Iwao** has caught fish, her friends' favorite pets, the **Mermaids**. For **Nari**, this is barbaric and she finds it hard to watch. Her friend, a simple boy from the village of **Mura**, helps her deal with it."
