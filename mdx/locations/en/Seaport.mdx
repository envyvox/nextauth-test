The port city of **Nagoa** grew from the meager dwellings of port workers and sailors who settled here after the port was built by the great ruler **Toku**.
The port became the pearl of commerce and the heart of the country's economy, raising the ruler's prestige in the eyes of the common people to unprecedented heights.
Since the development of **Nagoya's** surroundings did not begin immediately, but was gradual over many years, slowly but surely growing through the rainy seasons, making the architecture near the sea seem as ancient as the northernmost lands of the continent.

Originally, the harbor did not look as grand as it does now.
It was a quiet harbor, a haven for fishermen and expeditioners traveling to distant seas.
But soon Captain **Iwao** and his crew made the place uniquely famous by finding sunken treasure in the eastern ocean. At that time, people interested in finding the treasure and the mysterious «Underwater Kingdom of Poseidon» began to appear in the harbor more frequently.

Also, residents of the city say that in one of the expeditions, the same one in which Captain **Iwao** and found the treasure, there were several other important events that should not be left unnoticed.
For example, a huge net of exotic and predatory fish! One fish was so huge that its head was hung on the bow of the ship! And when the whole crew went ashore, one sailor with eyes to roll out loudly said: «These lousy tailed beauties only know how to flutter their tongues, they'll drag you into the abyss of waves, and then you'll be forgotten...».

No one could imagine that near the islands live fantastic fish-men, sirens and mermaids.
They only tell fairy tales about them to children, don't they?
But it is still not clear whether it was true or drunken delirium of the old sailor....
