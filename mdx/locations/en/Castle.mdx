An ancient castle built of stone and wood, surrounded by a moat and protective walls belonged to the **Toku** family for many centuries. However, after another siege of the castle, the land was exhausted, the rivers with fresh water were blocked with clumps, it became very difficult to live, so they decided to leave the castle.

The area became uninteresting to anyone except **Ioshiro**. He was wandering around the abandoned castle and saw a huge crack in the dungeon that appeared after the last siege on the castle. He equipped himself and decided to go down into the depths and found deposits of various ores.

One day while returning from the mines, the wanderer heard someone screaming. At first he thought he was imagining it, for the sound was muffled, as if someone were behind a wall.

«No, that's impossible» thought **Shiro** and started to gather his tools.

But he couldn't sleep that day, thinking about the strange sounds.

«Maybe someone survived the siege.... No, that's crazy, it's been a long time...» **Ioshiro** pondered, fumbling with the string.

Without waiting for the morning, the miner gathered all the necessary tools and went to the place where he heard unknown screams. After thinking it over and weighing it all over again, he decides to dig.

After a few hours, **Ioshiro** dug through the passage and saw a certain tunnel with various branches. As the miner walked down one of them, he heard a scream again, but it sounded like it was coming from around a corner. **Shiro** cautiously reached it, looked out and was stunned. Huge monsters were trying to divide their prey among themselves.

The frightened miner rushed to the exit, looking around to make sure no one was following him. Once outside, **Ioshiro** couldn't come to his senses for a long time, but after a while he decided that he had to get rid of them at all costs, or they might get out someday.
