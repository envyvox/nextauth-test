The village of **Mura** can be seen behind the spacious fields of rice and buckwheat. The village began with a couple of thatched houses, one of which was inhabited by **Osaki.** The gray-bearded man liked to grow a lot of fruit, so in time his small beds were full of fruit.

The gray-bearded man liked to grow a lot of fruit at his place, so over time his small beds with the little house turned into a large farm. Years later, new buildings began to appear around his farm. People come here, build homes for themselves and their pets, and grow crops for their families and to sell.

The villagers coexist in perfect harmony with nature, so there is a small temple where they come with offerings for favorable weather.

Now the grandson of **Osaka** - **Kio**, having lost his beloved grandfather and father, continues their work - growing crops, farming. In his free time he would get to the flowering garden, where he would take a book and read about the history of the world, and there he met **Nari**.

They themselves did not notice how they became close friends who shared their experiences and always helped each other.
